# SPQR-Team-2019 REVAMPED

Official Code+CAD's of 2018-2019 SPQR 1st at Romecup2019, Rome Best Robot Design at Robocup2019, Sydney

Original Team:

#include <E.Latino> 

#include <A.Ghezzi>

#include <E.Coletta>

#include <D.Casagrande>

#include <S.Sannino>

#include <G.Treccape>

<br>

Now just a casual revamp of the old project, solving some mechanics problems and using the codebase from our [2020-2021 robot](!https://github.com/spqr-team/SPQR-Team1). Testing new techniques and serving as an opponent to newer members of the team.

Currently I'm: Emanuele Coletta [[@EmaMaker](https://git.emamaker.com)] <br>
with some help on the mechanics from: Davide Belli [@DVDSPACCA]
